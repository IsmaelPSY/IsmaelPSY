**Hello, I'm Ismael Sanchez** ðŸŒŸ

I'm a systems engineer, web developer, and self-learner. Here's a bit about me:

- My favorite programming language is Elixir, although I'm also skilled in JavaScript and currently learning TypeScript. ðŸ’»
- Professionally, I specialize in backend development, but I also enjoy working on frontend projects in my personal and freelance work. My goal is to master all aspects of web development, including DevOps. ðŸš€
- I'm always open to new opportunities and projects. I thrive on challenges and love exploring new technologies. ðŸ’¡
- I'm a proud father of a beautiful 2-year-old baby and a lucky husband to an amazing woman. Together, the three of us are taking steps forward in life. ðŸ‘ª

If you'd like to know more about me, feel free to reach out to my personal email at ismaelpsy.12@gmail.com. I'd be happy to connect with you! ðŸ“§

Thank you! Greetings! ðŸŒŸ
